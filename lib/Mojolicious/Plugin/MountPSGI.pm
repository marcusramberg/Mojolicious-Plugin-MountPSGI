=head1 NAME

Mojolicious::Plugin::MountPSGI - Mount PSGI apps

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  # Mojolicious
  $self->plugin('MountPSGI', { '/' => 'ext/MyApp/app.psgi'});

  # Mojolicious::Lite
  plugin 'MountPSGI', { '/' => 'ext/MyApp/app.psgi' };

  # rewrite the path so the psgi app doesn't see the mount point
  # thus app.psgi sees / when /mount is visited
  plugin 'MountPSGI', { '/mount' => 'ext/MyApp/app.psgi', rewrite => 1 };

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<Mojolicious::Plugin::MountPSGI> lets you mount any PSGI app
inside a Mojolicious app. For instance you could use this to
deploy your PSGI app under hypnotoad, or to include a PSGI
app inside a path inside your Mojo app.

The key given is the route under which to mount the app. The
value is either a PSGI application or a string which resolves
to an instance via L<Plack::Util/load_psgi>.

One additional option is C<rewrite> which if set to a true value
will rewrite the C<PATH_INFO> and C<SCRIPT_NAME> values in the env
hash so that the application does not see the mount point in
its request path. This uses the mechanism as described by L<Plack::App::URLMap>.

=head1 METHODS

L<Mojolicious::Plugin::MountPSGI> inherits all methods from
L<Mojolicious::Plugin> and implements the following new ones.

=head2 C<register>

  $plugin->register;
